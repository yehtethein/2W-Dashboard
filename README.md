# 3W-Dashboard
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Myanmar 3W project.

This dashboard gives an interactive view of Who is doing What, Where at State/Region or Township or Village Tract level. The activities of agencies which did not report to village tract level cannot be shown on the VT map. Select the area, sector, agency etc of interest to see the customised view. This is an interactive dashboard => https://public.tableau.com/views/OrganizationInfo/3WDashboard?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
